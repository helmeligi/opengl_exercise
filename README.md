![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/5) 

This is a sample project I use to practice openGL. It shall be followed by some awesome applications. So this project is just learning openGL tutorials implementation with documenations to be ready for building my next project (RubiksCube Modeling & Solve). I am following these nice tutorials:
https://learnopengl.com/

## Installing / Getting started

To install openGL environment on Ubuntu, you can follow the steps in this link:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17768008/how-to-build-install-glfw-3-and-use-it-in-a-linux-project

Afterwards, you can just run the example in the template project to enure that the environment is up and running, to run the example:
                                                                                                                       

```shell
cd learnOpenGL/Debug                       
make
./learnOpenGL   
```

You can start running the examples, just enter the id of the test to run.
